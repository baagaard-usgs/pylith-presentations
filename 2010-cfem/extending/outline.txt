How can PyLith be extended?

  Any component can be replaced

  What would be difficult
    Changing the governing equations

Overview of PyLith component
  Python
  Swig
  C/C++

Getting started

  What module(s) do I want to replace?
  What interfaces must my new module honor?
  What are the parameters of my new module?
  Are the parameters uniform or do they vary spatially?


Steps in creating custom component

  Create the Python object
    Setup the user-specified parameters
    Transfer parameters to C++

  Create the C++ object
    Functions/methods to satisfy interface
    Accessor functions/methods to accept parameters from Python
    Functions/methods to implement functionality

  Use SWIG to glue Python and C++ together
    Create interface file from C++ header

Example: Bulk constitutive model
