Friction
  how implemented
  parameters (initial stress, fault constitutive model)
  fault constitutive models
    static friction
    linear slip-weakening
    rate and state friction
  must use nonlinear solver with sparse system Jacobian matrix
  Example

Finite-strain
  Stress/strain measures
    Green-Lagrange strains
    Second Piola-Kirchhoff stresses
    stress/strain tensors are with respect to undeformed coordinates
  Features included
    rigid body motion
    small strains
  nonlinear solver with sparse system Jacobian matrix selected automatically
  Example - step ??
